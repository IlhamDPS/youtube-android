# Android Demo Projects

Source code as seen in my YouTube videos!

Demo projects are split into separate folders within this repository, check them out!

If you want to open the code in Android Studio, you'll need to open the root folder.

- [Dagger 2](dagger-2/README.md): dependency injection
- [EnhancedAdapter](enhanced-adapter/README.md): a `RecyclerView.Adapter` extension
- [Navigation](navigation/README.md): handle everything needed for in-app navigation
- [Room](room/README.md): fluent SQLite database access
- [ViewModel](view-model/README.md): manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way
